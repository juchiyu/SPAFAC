A data frame with 460 rows and variables for each MACS item, demographic
information, and academic performance scores. Each MACS item is labeled according
to its domain and number, with additional columns for overall scores and categorized
academic performance.

\description{
This dataset comprises responses to the Math Assessment for College Students
(MACS) from undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory psychology
statistics course at an urban public college in the northeast United States.
The MACS, a 30-item paper-and-pencil test covering five content domains
(Algebra, Arithmetic, Categorization and Ranges, Decimals/Fractions/Percentages,
and Visual Understanding), was administered across five semesters to 460 participants.
}
\details{
The MACS test measures basic mathematics skills and was completed in approximately
40 minutes during the first week of the semester. Responses were binary scored
(0 = incorrect, 1 = correct) with no partial credit. The course was computationally
based, involving manual statistical tests and software programs. Academic performance
was assessed through three exams per semester, with scores averaged and categorized
into letter grades (A, B, C, D, F). For analysis purposes, grades A and B were grouped
together, as were D and F, resulting in three groups (AB, C, DF).

Informed consent was obtained under an IRB-approved protocol, and no compensation
was provided. Demographic and academic performance data were also collected.
The dataset is used to examine relationships between basic mathematics skills,
demographic data, and academic performance.
